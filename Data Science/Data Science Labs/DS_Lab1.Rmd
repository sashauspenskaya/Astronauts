#1 We can use functions to produce repetitive calculations and errors. Functions can be used to maximize efficiency and makes code easier to understand.Functions can be reused, which saves people a lot of time and effort

#2

```{r}
z_score <- function(x, m,a) {
  (x-m)/a
}

print(z_score(25.77,23.54,2.442))
```

#3

```{r}
logg<- function(n,p) {
  L=(log(n)*log10(n))/(p)^(1/3)
  print(round(L,digits=1))
  
}

logg(32,11)
```

```{r}
data(mtcars)

output <- vector("double", ncol(mtcars))   
for (i in seq_along(mtcars)) {              
  output[[i]] <- sd(mtcars[[i]])
